# Analyzing Netflix Viewership: Key Trends and Patterns

## 📊 Objective
This project explores the demographic and behavioral patterns of Netflix users, calculating key performance metrics such as **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**. The analysis derives actionable insights from factors like age, geographic location, device preferences, and subscription plans.

## 📁 Dataset
The dataset should include the following key columns:
- **User ID**: A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Subscription Type**: The category of subscription (e.g., Basic, Extended, Premium).
- **Monthly Revenue**: The monthly income generated from each user.

## 🔑 Key Metrics
- Number of users per country, with data visualized using graphs and tables.
- Focus on the top five countries for viewership and revenue generation.

## 💡 Recommendations
- Targeted marketing should focus on regions with the highest customer lifetime value (e.g., **United States** and **Spain**) for promoting premium content.
- Specialized marketing campaigns in **France** are recommended, as users there show a higher average lifetime value.

## 🔄 Next Steps
Future analysis will assess **customer acquisition costs** across various regions, comparing markets like **France** and the **U.S.** to identify cost-efficient acquisition strategies.

## 📈 Data Visualizations
Data is visualized in charts and tables to highlight trends and insights.

## 📌 Conclusion
The insights derived will help shape marketing efforts to maximize revenue and improve customer acquisition strategies.
